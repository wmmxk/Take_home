### Summary
This repo is for a regression project, in which a continuous variable was predicted based on six numerical features and two categorical features. <br />
Two types of model, Gaussian Process and Feedforward Neural Network, were used to make predictions (./code/GP_FFN). The two models both achieved a PCC of 0.98 between prediction and truth on the training set in 5-fold-cross-validation.
